If you prefer to run this locally on your machine, run these commands from the root project folder to start the Express server:
npm install<br />
npm start<br />

Then run these commands in a separate terminal instance to run the React App:
<br />
cd client<br />
npm install<br />
npm start<br />

Now you can see the app when you navigate to http://localhost:3000/
