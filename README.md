The front end of the project was created with React and features the use of state in fully controlled forms and props in pure/functional components with separation of concerns in mind. It also features the use of caching via local storage in lieu of a database due to the simple use case. The back end consists of Node/Express with error handling on the routes.
<br />
<br />
If you prefer to run this locally on your machine, run these commands from the root project folder to start the Express server:
npm install<br />
npm start<br />
<br />
Then run these commands in a separate terminal instance to run the React App:
<br />
cd client<br />
npm install<br />
npm start<br />
<br />
Now you can see the app when you navigate to http://localhost:3000/
